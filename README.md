This assignment was part of my work as a student research assistant at the Institute for Information Technology and Communications at the Otto-von-Guericke University. 
This repository contains two implementations of the McAdams coefficient. The Python implementation was availabale as a source code which was modified and changed into C++ in an attempt to make it faster. The MATLAB code implementation was implemented to be used as a learning aid in the Digital Signal Processing Lab course. 
The C++ and the MATLAB implemntation takes an audio file as an input, annonyomizes the speaker and then outputs an anonymized version of the original file.
