This assignment was part of my work as a student research assistant at the Institute for Information Technology and Communications at the Otto-von-Guericke University. 
This repository contains two implementations of the McAdams coefficient. The Python implementation was availabale as a source code which was modified and changed into C++ in an attempt to make it faster. The MATLAB code implementation was implemented to be used as a learning aid in the Digital Signal Processing Lab course. 
The C++ and the MATLAB implemntation takes an audio file as an input, annonyomizes the speaker and then outputs an anonymized version of the original file. For the time being, LPC coefficients have to be provided to the C++ implementation in form of a text file.

Original Python version given at: https://github.com/Voice-Privacy-Challenge/Voice-Privacy-Challenge-2020/blob/master/baseline/local/anon/anonymise_dir_mcadams.py
